Platform as a Reflection of Values: Joyent, Node.js and Beyond

Bryan Cantrill, CTO, Joyent

Software platform decisions are big important decisions with large consequences.
We choose a platform, and community, and the values of that community.
Values are in tension.
Subset choices, core values, often are not articulated.
Unix core values: portability, simplicity, composability.
OpenBSD core value: security.
Awk core values: simplicity, velocity, expressiveness.
DTrace core values: safety, operability.
Third rail you cannot cross - debug in production.
Node core values 2010: approachability, performance, simplicity.
Write performant async app in fewer lines of code.
Joyent values 2010: safety, stability, rigor.
Joyent values now --
Nothing more clarifying than being presented by exploit in own code.
Guy found an exploit in our software.
We hired him.
Whole new way of bringing security into how we think and prioritize things.
Core values often track people.
Node.js demographics - these were not lightweights.
Joyent built own infrastructure on Node.
Brendan Gregg invented flame graphs at Joyent for Node.
We developed Bunyan logging in 2012.
Dynamically turn on DTrace in a microservice.
Developed Restify, RFC compliance.
Developed vasync lib, use it instead of async lib.
Post-mortem core dump, inspect closure bindings.
Use v8plus instead of NaN or N-API.
Values are not contagious.
Not everyone had these values.
Node values: approachability, expressiveness, velocity.
TJ Holowaychuk's Farewell to Node.js.
Left Node due to conflict of values.
TJ and Felix went to Golang.
Highlights the challenge of community.
Must constantly rearticulate values.
Need strong identity around values.
Most people just leave silently.
Joyent learned the hard way --
We held aspirations for Node that Node did not hold for itself.
So we transitioned Node to a foundation in 2015.
Issue, Promises, Barbara Liskov invented Promises in the 1980s.
Promises, debuggability, can't accomodate both value systems.
Elections do not resolve differences in values with votes.
Joyent is continuing with Node, but looking beyond.
Will see Joyent active in Go, Rust, perhaps others.
Will bring our debuggability.
We might deploy Go, Rust, due to their values.
Node needs to clarify their values.
Be clear about values when choose between approachability and reliability.
