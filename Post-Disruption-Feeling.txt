That Post-Disruption Feeling

Matt Edelman, Manager, Node Infrastructure, PayPal

Node, Kraken, 1 billion hits per day at PayPal.
Amazing how much a small team can do with Node.
But one tiny module with an error could explode everything.
We do Agile, backlog, stories, standups, not all the meetings.
Prioritization, communication.
Shared understanding of what we're working on.
Kraken.js:
  - Express wrapper.
  - Promotes consistency across applications.
  - Standardizes around security.
Web site is outdated, working on that.
Direct dependencies make upgrades challenging.
Becomes complicated.
Goal is to shorten build times.
Why above 45 minutes?  Want 4 minutes.
Low hanging fruit.
Build image with everything it needs.
Base image will have some of this stuff.
Get rid of legacy non-Docker stuff.
Not easy to push change through large corporation.
Weird legacy, using PhantomJS in production to create PDF files.
Transpiling in production.
Nodeops dashboard.
Track module and Node versions.
Group together upgrades we want teams to do.
Performance improvement: isolate, measure, magic, repeat.
Applications shouldn't need to include so much infrastructure.
Q&A:
Will open source Nodeops dashboard when it is ready.
Open source needs to come from solving a practical problem.
