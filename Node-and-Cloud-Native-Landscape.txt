Node.js and the Rapidly Evolving Cloud Native Landscape

What is cloud native?
Composed of containerized microservices deployed in a dynamically orchestrated environment.
Deployment artifact, tarball, something you run.
Container includes Node modules, env vars.
Universal repeatability, portability.
Increased resource efficiency, less RAM, CPU, HDD than VMs.
Share a lot with host machine.
Orchestrator, tool lets you treat a cluster of servers like it was one.
Handles scheduling, fault tolerance, etc.
Cattle, not pets.
Kubernetes.
Shipping is your company's heartbeat.
Demo (Docker and Kubernetes demo, by Microsoft).
@code editor environment:
  - Containerize your app.
  - Add Docker files to workspace.
  - Node 6 Alpine.
  - Provides operational transparency.
  - Auto completion on Docker config.
  - Docker Compose, run set of containers together as a unit.
  - Build complex things off of primitives.
  - F5, attache to app.
  - Single-step debug inside container.
How deploy in practice?
Kubernetes.
Minikube, local dev environment.
Emulate complex Kubernetes cluster on local machine.
kubectl CLI.
Kubernetes is security conscious.
Minikube runs in a VM.
Run on local machine, on-prem, or cloud.
Kubernetes + Node = digital transformation.
