Technology and org structures are intertwined.
Conway's Law.
When you change the technology, org structures change.
Decompose monolith into units of work.
Untangle the spaghetti code, make it composable.
How do we:
  - Share modules across feature teams?
  - Do version control?
  - Reduce risk of total app failure?
rifi library.
Export components from service.
service.exports();
Single unit of deployment.
npm install rifi
Export a service, deploy it, it just works.
Dependency serialization.
upring, Node app sharding.
rifi, distributed dependency trees.
