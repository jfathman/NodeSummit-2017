The Future is Serverless: What that Means for Node.js

Chris Anderson, Senior Program Manager, Microsoft

Started Functions Project, Azure.
Major cloud vendors started with Node first.
Chose Node:
  - JavaScript is the English of programming languages.
  - JavaScript is very accessible for users.
  - Rich ecosystem.
Node is:
  - Lightweight, helps reduce cold start.
  - Distributed, horizontally scaled.
  - No compilation.
  - Runs on multiple OS's.
What does serverless do for Node devs?
  - Makes background processing a breeze.
  - Scaling easier than ever.
New ecosystem of serverless friendly Node modules.
Minimal, load time friendly, other new tooling.
Node package authors need to be more considerate on memory and think about load time.
Serverless implementations are vendor specific, and could splinter community.
Node and serverless are perfect for each other.
Serverless was successful because of the open community that Node grew.
