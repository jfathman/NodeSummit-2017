Demo serverless app, explain security flaws.
Using 'Serverless Framework' on Lambda.
YAML, CRUD, serverless functions.
Using curl | jq to make pretty.
Are npm modules secure?
Bits of infrastructure.
aws-snyk check vulnerable modules.
regex can block event loop.
reDoS is regex DoS.
regex catastrophic backtracking.
Serverless is immune to DoS if spin up more capacity.
Billed duration.
So denies access to bank account.
Remote command execution on server (AWS).
Use key management in serverless environment.
For performance reasons, Lambda and others keep serverless instances warm.
Data may not disappear after FaaS completes.
Don't think serverless is immutable.
Strong as weakest link.
Single function can topple the system.
Each function is an attack surface.
Functions are almost free.
Cost due to risk/damage is not so free.
