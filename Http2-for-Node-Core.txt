HTTP2 for Node.js Core

James Snell, Open Source Architect, nearForm

Node core contributor full time.
TSC committee member.
Wrote implementation of HTTP2 for Node.
Year of hard work.
RFC 7540 HTTP version 2.
Example: require('http2');
Pull request last week.
Try to land soon, 45K lines of code.
Adds 100 new tests.
Will take a while to review.
Uses nghttp2 library.

    +-------------------+
    | require('http2'); |
    +-------------------+
    |    node_http2     |
    +---------+---------+
    | nghttp2 |  libuv  |
    +---------+---------+

What works now?
  - Push streams.
  - Multiplexing, practical limit ~200 concurrent streams.
  - Flow control, due to multiplexing.
  - Prioritization, such as video playing in other tab.
  - Header compression, HTTP/2 stateful, delta-based header compression,
      reuses header data, only sends changes, reduces traffic by 80%.
  - Plain text and TLS, Node supports plain text, browser requires TLS.
  - Client and server.
  - Server-side send file.
  - Partial HTTP/1 compatibility.
Soon:
  - Client-side send file.
  - Performance optimizations.
  - Working with async hooks.
  - HTTP/2 protocol extensions.
Git clone https://github.com/nodejs/http2.
Build takes a long time, V8, etc.
Flag is temporary in Node 8 until Node 9:
  NODE_DEBUG=http2 ./node --expose-http2
Server-side push.
We don't know how people will use this.
Could populate cache.
Server side respond with file.
Huge performance improvement over current Node.
Not as fast as NGINX.
Can control stat permissions, etc.
With HTTP/2, 200 OK, etc. status messages are gone.
Goal is to land HTTP/2 in Node 8.x as experimental.
With luck, fully supported in Node 9.x, Oct 2017.
Q&A:
Benchmarking the client.
Just under HTTP/1 client file uploads due to additional buffering.
Throttling.
Don't have best practices yet.
Get code in front of people, get feedback.
Don't want to prematurely optimize.
Want to wait before optimizing.
