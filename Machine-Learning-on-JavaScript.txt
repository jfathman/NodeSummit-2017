Machine Learning on JavaScript

Why Node.js?
Already have r-project, tensorflow, etc.
Why JavaScript?
Right tool for the job.
Easier to onboard people.
Lots of modules.
We love JavaScript.
What is machine learning?
Arthur Samuel: Gives computer ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
Types of learning:
  - Unsupervised learning.
      Figuring out patterns of data, how it can be grouped.
  - Supervised learning.
      Learning by example.
      Labeled data, feed to model.
Classification problems.
Types of algorithms, KNN, CART, SVM, NB, ANN.
Neural networks.
Synaptic.js, architecture-free neural network lib for Node and the browser.
Neataptic, neurons, activation functions:
  - Logistic Sigmoid
  - Rectified Linear Unit
  - Hyperbolic Tangent
  - Hard Limit Functions
Sigmoids are pretty popular.
Neurons: project, activate, propagate, gate.
Code example, using Synaptic.js in Node:
  - Building a neural network.
  - Train neural network for XOR truth table.
  - Need to normalize data for input.
Other types of networks, convolutional neural network.
